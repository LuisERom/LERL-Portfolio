The setup used Mach–Zehnder modulators and a traveling-wave SOA to generate pre- and post-synaptic optical pulses at different frequencies. By adjusting pulse timing, I modeled potentiation and depression behavior analogous to neuronal learning. The simulation produced distinct STDP curves—potentiation and depression windows—demonstrating the timing-dependent gain response of the SOA. This project deepened my understanding of optical neuromorphic computing principles and exposed limitations in parameter sensitivity and response stability of the modeled system.\n\n\n Reference paper: Photonic implementation of a neuronal learning algorithm based on spike timing dependent plasticity \n Reference link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7121946",

The structural integrity of the origami was confirmed through gel electrophoresis, and fluorescence imaging verified strong Cy3 binding to its complementary adaptors. These results demonstrated stable fluorophore incorporation and established a foundation for future biosensing applications. Limitations in Cy5 detection, due to equipment wavelength range, were also identified. The findings were presented at the UC Berkeley SUPERB-AI4E Tech Talk (2024).",
